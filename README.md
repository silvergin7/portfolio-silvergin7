# Tim Björnhov Özkan – Portfolio

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio built with semantic HTML and modern CSS. It is part of my studies in the Blockchain Developer program at Medieinstitutet and is designed to showcase my background, projects, and contact information.

## Features

- Responsive, mobile‑first layout with media queries for different screen sizes.
- Semantic HTML structure using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.
- Projects section highlighting Web3/DeFi‑related work (Funicular Protocol, Endless Web Worlds, and crypto/trading content).
- Accessible contact form with labels, required fields, and clear focus states.
- Sidebar (`aside`) with contact details and current focus areas, adapting layout on larger screens.
- Light/dark theme support using CSS custom properties and `prefers-color-scheme`.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3
  - Custom CSS based on Josh Comeau’s “Modern CSS Reset”
  - Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
  - CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode)

## Project Structure

.
├── index.html # Main portfolio page
├── main.css # Global styles, reset, layout and themes
└── images/ # Profile photo, project logos, social icons

## Running the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser  
   – or use a simple static server / VS Code Live Server extension for local development. 
3. Resize the browser window to see how the layout adapts on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

No build step is required; the site is pure HTML and CSS.

## Accessibility & UX Notes

- Uses semantic landmarks (header, main, nav, footer, aside) to help screen readers navigate.
- Navigation and interactive elements have visible focus styles for keyboard users.
- Color contrast in both light and dark themes is tuned for readability.
- Form inputs inherit font styles and use sufficient font size for better usability on mobile.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed project pages or case studies.
- Integrate basic JavaScript (for example, a manual theme toggle or form enhancements).
- Expand with additional Web3 / smart contract projects as they are completed.
