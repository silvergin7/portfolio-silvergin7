            <p>I've always liked figuring things out and finding better ways to do them.
                That mindset naturally pulled me toward blockchain and Web3, where ideas can actually turn into
                something real and useful.
                I'm currently studying blockchain development to sharpen my skills and build a stronger foundation for
                what I want to create.
                I'm the kind of person who prefers building over talking, and I enjoy seeing how tech, design and logic
                can work together when it's done right.
                What drives me most is creating things that have purpose and that people can actually use.</p>

        <section id="experience">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Before getting into blockchain, I worked in customer service, retail and warehouse jobs.
                It taught me how to stay focused, take responsibility and handle things properly when it matters.
                For the past few years, I've been fully immersed in the crypto and blockchain space, trading and
                investing full time while following the industry closely.
                I've also been involved in Web3 projects like Funicular Protocol and Endless Web Worlds.
                Since 2025, I've been studying blockchain development at Medieinstitutet, while also learning HTML and
                CSS to build a stronger technical foundation for what I want to create moving forward.</p>

                <h3>Funicular: A deflationary DeFi protocol</h3>
                <p>Among other things, I mainly helped with the philosophy behind choosing
                    the right farms during different market environments, and how to balance rewards between compounding
                    and buybacks.</p>
