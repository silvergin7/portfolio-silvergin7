            <p>I've always liked figuring things out and finding better ways to do them.
                That mindset naturally pulled me toward blockchain and Web3, where ideas can actually turn into
                something real and useful.
                I'm currently studying blockchain development to sharpen my skills and build a stronger foundation for
                what I want to create.
                I'm the kind of person who prefers building over talking, and I enjoy seeing how tech, design and logic
                can work together when it's done right.
                What drives me most is creating things that have purpose and that people can actually use.</p>
